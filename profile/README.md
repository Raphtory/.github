Raphtory is a powerful analytics engine for large-scale graph analysis. It lets you run complex queries on your data, 
no matter where it's stored or what format it's in. But that's not all - Raphtory's real superpower is its ability to 
track and explore the history of a complex system, from "time traveling" through data to executing advanced analysis 
like taint tracking, temporal reachability, and mining temporal motifs.

**Raphtory is easy to use:** just run a single `pip install raphtory` command and embed it with your existing Python/Pandas pipeline for input and output.

**Raphtory is expressive:** It's designed to represent all types of graph queries and has a well-developed API for exploring your data across its history.

**Raphtory is lightning-fast and scales effortlessly**: Our core is built upon rust. Raphtory can be run on a laptop or a distributed cluster for terabyte-scale graphs.
